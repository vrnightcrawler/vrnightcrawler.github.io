## **_Create your own VR physical body with just one script ！！！_**

**VR PHYSICAL BODY** is a VR physical interaction framework developed based on OpenXR.For any Humanoid character, **VR PHYSICAL BODY** can be generated with one script ,and you can physically interact with scene objects, and this tool is very easy to use.

## **VR PHYSICAL BODY** include:
* The physical body and automatic generator, including upper limb and finger colliders, runs on the basis of IK.
* Dynamic finger posture adjustment system when grasping, for the vast majority of objects without pre-editing the finger posture, greatly saving the development time of VR projects.
* Assisted grasping system. If the holding position is not required, there is no need to add additional scripts to scene objects.
* Custom gesture editing function.
* Optimization of force distribution for two-handed grip.
* Physical motion controller, which supports smooth movement, climbing, etc., provides the option to reduce FOV to relieve motion sickness.
* Perfect physics-based damage system.
* Simple sound and vibration system.
* Simple storage system.

### **Example scenarios include:**
* An object which can receive collision damage
* A toy car control system with some common VR physical interaction prefabs, such as steering wheel, button, shift.
* Example weapons: including gun, sword and hammer

_Compatible with [**Physical AI**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/physical-ai-231682)._
