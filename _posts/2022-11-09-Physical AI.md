## **_Physical AI_** mainly includes:
* Physically based character animation performance with internal collision option
* One click creates humanoid dynamic ragdolls and automatically calculates joint limits.
* Automatic setting of joint spring and damper based on total mass, achieving good dynamic ragdoll performance without manual adjustment.
* Provide sample player and AI scripts with basic state transitions and damage calculation system(including falling damage).

Compatible with (**VR PHYSICAL BODY**)[https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/230540]
